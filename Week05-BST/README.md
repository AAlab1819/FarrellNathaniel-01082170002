## 1. Party ([115 A](http://codeforces.com/contest/115/problem/A))  
[Submission](http://codeforces.com/contest/115/submission/43792870)  
A company is going to hold a party, but they want all the employees to be in a separate groups in which none of them are a superior of another. We need to know how many groups will be formed if there are *n* employees.

The first *n* input will decide how many employees there are in the company. The next input line will decide who is the manager of that employee in that *i*.  
After inputting *n*, we'll start with first employee
```
input 1: 2            #there are two employees
input 2: -1           #Employee 1
input 3: 1            #Employee 2 which boss is Employee 1
```
'-1' means employee in that position does not have any superiors.
```
5
4
5
1
-1
4
```
This will output 3, because there are 3 groups in this arrangement of employees:
- Employee 1 and 5
- Employee 2 and 3
- Employee 4
